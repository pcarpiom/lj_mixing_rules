# lj_mixing_rules
This script creates combining rules from a set of 12-6/9-6 epsilon/sigma parameters. The input file is a .txt file with the following structure. 

Index LJ-type* Epsilon Sigma 

*Two types are implemented 
  1) 12 for Lorentz-Berthelot rules (12-6 parameters)
  2) 9 for Waldman-Hagler rules (9-6 parameters)

Waldman-Hagler rules are generated for the case of mixed interactions.

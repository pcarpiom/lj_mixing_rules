# lj_mixing_rules
This script creates combining rules given a set of 12-6/9-6 epsilon and sigma parameters. The input file is simply a .txt file with the following structure. 

Index LJ* Epsilon Sigma 

*Two options are implemented 
  1) 12 for 12-6 parameters. Lorentz-Berthelot rules are generated
  2) 9 for 9-6 parameters. Waldman-Hagler rules are generated

Waldman-Hagler rules are generated for the case of the mixed interactions.
